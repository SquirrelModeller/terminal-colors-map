# Color Mapping

This repository documents how the 256-color palette maps to various terminal applications.

The goal is to help people understand how specific color values are used, making it easier to create color tables and themes.

Ideally every terminal application will have its own markdown file, where all each color mapping is explained. Currently it is just written to a singular file.
